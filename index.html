        <h2 class="w3-wide">MENTAL HEALTH STIGMA IN MUSLIM COMMUNITIES</h2>
        <p class="w3-opacity"><i>By Adib Shaikh</i></p>
        <p class="w3-justify">
          My name is Adib Shaikh, I am 19 years old, and I am here to share a story with you all about my experience growing up with Mental health stigma in the Muslim community.
           I have given it some thought, and I believe the time has come to share my narrative and my experiences with the mental health system in the hopes of:
        </p>
          Let people know they are not alone   
        <p>
          Help end the stigma and discrimination which continues to exist
        </p>
        Help make a change for the Future Kids 
       <p>
        <p>
          There are various stigmas associated with mental health in the community of people of color. 
          Growing up in a world with so many diverse cultures and types of people can sometimes distract you from your own culture and the things you need to fulfill as a person. 
          I am concerned about this issue because it involves young children going down the wrong route or doing something they are pressured to do, and others should be concerned for the same reason. 
          This is mostly a problem in Middle eastern households because of exceedingly grand expectations that put children under pressure to study something they do not want to do or are not interested in doing. 
          When forced to do so, many people get agitated and fall under the category of Mental Health Stigma.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up in a city called Bolingbrook, IL. From what I remember, I was always the quiet kid who did not really have anyone to talk to and no one wanted to talk to me. 
        At that time I wore a “Topi”, which is a hat your wear as a Muslim boy. The traditional hat that Muslim men wear is known as the Topi, which is a raised and rounded skullcap. 
        Muslim men wear this hat because they believe that Muhammad ﷺ always had his head covered, making it a recommended act for members of the religion today to also cover their head. 
        This was somthing non-muslim children didn’t understand and when kids don’t understand something, they tend to be afraid or make fun of it. In my case, it was to make fun of. 
        I don’t blame them much now, but at the time it impacted my life significantly. At that age I was told I was weird and called names I do not wish to repeat. It was hard to make friends, 
        I was told I smelled dirty (which wasn’t the case). It was a way to spread rumors about me… all because I would wear a small item on my head. 
        At that time there was no support system in our school to help me.
      </p>
       <p>
        During this time of my life. From elementary school to high school there was no “functional” support system or way for us students to speak to adults for help. 
        And let's be honest, most regular teachers are not qualified to help in these situations with no fault of their own. 
        “Studies on ethnic minorities have consistently pointed out that even when mainstream agencies offer a full complement of mental health programs, 
        they are significantly underutilized or not utilized at all by ethnic minorities” (Basit and Hamid). These populations' lack of understanding and awareness of mental health concerns is a big disadvantage.
         Moving to America at a young age not speaking english properly i was bullied and teacher did not care if i was learning nor helped the bulling stop until my parents stepped up, 
         i think to my self quite a lot on how many kids are going throught something like this, it hurts me to think about where i was and to see someone else in that same situation. 
       </p>
       <p>
        I read bunch of articles but theres one that really stood out to me and its by Amanda Saleh, she talk about her friends situation who has gone through a lot, Noora grew up in Denver, Colorado, during a time when there were few Arab Americans or Muslims. 
        No one understood her culture or religion because she resided in a largely White community.
        After reading this thoroughly I started to see a lot of similarities in growing up in America as a practicing Muslim, after finishing reading Amanda Saleh's blog two quotes stood out to me which I related to heavily
        “I struggled with depression and anxiety all throughout high school and college” (Saleh). said Noora, I struggled with the same problem growing up being the only Muslim kid in school I was bullied every day.
        Another quote that stood out to me was when Noora was explaining her situation wearing a hijab in an all-white school where there were not any Muslims “It initially started in middle school when I felt like an
        outcast because I was the only Muslim and hijab [woman wearing a headscarf] at school. I felt like there were so many differences between me and my peers, so I started isolating myself from everyone, which
        made it worse” (Saleh). I do not wear a hijab but from 3-7 grade I was told to wear a Topi which goes on top of your head for men its somewhat of a hijab but for men which only covers the top of your head. I
        was made fun of called names to which I never talked to anyone but soon stopped wearing it and my parents were understanding of my situation.
        
       </p>
       <p>
        As people in the Muslim American community continue to face distinct challenges related to mental illness and stigma, advocates and mental health professionals are working to come up with solutions. 
        “I want to give families and kids affected by mental illness the sense that they are not alone” (Hettenbach). 
        I really like this quote since i also feel obligated to help out thoes who are going throught what i went through we all need to come together and make a change no only for us for the future of 
        American Muslims.

                  We all have our own issues and stories to tell and they mean so much to us. Most people like to keep them personal, I am so glad you didn’t Adib.
                   I was able to relate on a personal level to your story and it helped me feel less alone in this world… That maybe,
                    there are others out there even now experiencing what I did and what you did. Thank you for being so open about your journey.

                  Hey Adib, thanks for sharing your story. As a man who also wore a Topi as a child, I understand everything you talked about. Even more than you would think.
                   Having an outlet to talk about your experiences and troubles is so important in our youth. Not taking care of your mental health can lead some people down a dark and miserable path in life. 
                   Again, thank you for bringing this to more people's attention and I hope this will help many other individuals like myself in the future.
                </p>

                  As a woman who follows Islam, many people have certain opinions of our faith. I also experienced the pain of being misunderstood as a child. 
                  The children I grew up with didn’t understand my head coverings and would pick on me because of it. Made me feel as if I was different or unwanted. 
                  I agree with what you stated, I wish schools had someone we could have spoken with who understood what we were going through.

        <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i>All About Mental Health </i></p>
        <h5>What is Mental Health?</h5>
         <ul>
            <li> 
              Mental health is our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Mental health does not only affect the way we think, feel, and act but also how we handle stress, relate to others, 
              and make choices.
            </li>
            <li>
              Emotional issues are not the only ones that affect one's mental health. For example, if a couple is having issues getting along; if parents and children are having difficulty seeing eye to eye; 
              or if a person is underperforming at school or work, a counselor or therapist may be able to help lead the individual toward addressing their problems.
            </li>
            <li>
              Whether it is due to biological causes, life events, or family history, it is critical to know that treatment is accessible.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>What Are Some Common Mental Health Issues?</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Stress- Defined as the bodys response to demand. Stress can cause physical, emotional and behavioral disorders which can affect your health and peace-of-mind, 
              as well as personal and professional relationships. Too much stress can cause relatively minor illnesses like insomnia, backaches, 
              or headaches, and can contribute to potentially life-threatening diseases like high blood pressure and heart disease.
            </li>
            <li>
              Panic Attacks- Sudden onset of intense fear and discomfort that reaches its peak within minutes and includes 4 of the following symptoms: 
              increased heartbeat, trembling, sweating, nausea, feeling of choking, chest pain, dizziness, fear of losing control, fear of dying, feeling of unreality, and numbness or tingling sensations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Marital Issues- Common disputes between spouses, family members involving physical abuse and/or psychological abuse.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>What Is The Connection Between Mental Health and Islam?</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Spiritual Resilience - Muslims may have a tranquil existence by harnessing their inner powers and having a strong relationship with the ultimate power, 
              Allah, being positive, cleansing their feelings, and not waiting for outer circumstances to improve. 
              Islam recognizes spiritual status as an inside power that may be used to maintain a peaceful mind, healthy consciousness, and happy ideas.
            </li>
            <li>
              Role of Patience - Patience is highly valued in Islam, and it is the subject of around 200 verses of the Quran, as well as being mentioned indirectly in many others. 
              Patience is a characteristic that allows Muslims to continue on their path toward worthwhile goals despite adversity or repeated provocations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Evil Eye (Ayn/ Nazar)- Belief in the evil eye is found in the Quran based on the following verse: “And from the evil of the envied when he envies," [Al-Falaq (The Daybreak),113:5]. 
              The concept of an evil eye is the belief that an individual can look at people, animals, or objects and cause harm due to jealousy.

          <li>
            Seek treatment - The most essential thing you can do is get treatment for your ailment or encourage others who are struggling to do so.
             Don't let the fear of being labeled with mental illness prevent you or your loved ones from seeking help. 
             Just as you would schedule an appointment with your doctor if you broke your leg or became ill, 
             don't let the fear of being labeled with mental illness prevent you or your loved ones from seeking help. 
             Treatment is critical for providing comfort and minimizing symptoms that interfere with one's professional and personal life. 
             Remember to be nice and kind with yourself and your loved ones as you seek therapy. It is difficult to seek for assistance. 
             Speaking up takes a lot of guts, and you (and your loved ones) are worth the effort.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don’t buy into the stigma - You may assume that mental illness is a sign of weakness and that you or the person experiencing it should be able to manage it on your own.
             Because of these perceptions, you may treat yourself or others severely. Seeking counseling, education, 
             being nice to oneself and others, and seeking support from those who have mental illnesses may all assist people with mental illnesses acquire good self-esteem, perspective, 
             and overcome damaging judgment. Education may also assist in moving one toward acceptance of the areas in which they struggle, as one learns that they are not alone. It is critical to seek assistance.
          
          </li>
          <li>
            Join a support group - Don't isolate yourself. Nobody can help folks who don't inform anybody about their issues with mental illness. Many local and national support groups provide programs and services. Furthermore, these organizations are working hard to educate people with mental disorders, 
            their families, supporting individuals, and communities in order to minimize stigma and progress toward empowerment and healing.
            The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) or the Department of Veterans Affairs (if applicable) are also excellent places to begin. Check with your county to discover what programs are available. 
            There are frequently online communities and resources for people diagnosed with mental disorders, as well as tools and organizations for those who assist them.
